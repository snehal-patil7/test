Sure! Here is a line-by-line explanation of the Terraform code:

arduinoCopy code
resource "null_resource""secrets_files"{ 
This is a Terraform null_resource block that creates an instance of a resource that does not exist in the target infrastructure. Instead, it is used to trigger actions or run commands in response to changes in other resources.

luaCopy code
for_each = local.secrets 
This for_each meta-argument creates one instance of the null_resource block for each element in the local.secrets map. The key and value of each element will be used later to generate a unique name and file content for each instance.

kotlinCopy code
triggers = { secret_version_id = data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.secrets[data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.secrets[each.key].name].version_id } 


This triggers argument defines a map of values that will cause this resource to be re-created or updated when they change. In this case, the trigger is the version_id of the latest version of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.
The trigger value is obtained by using the data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data source to get the latest version of the secret, and then looking up its version_id attribute using the name attribute of the corresponding aws_secretsmanager_secret resource.
The each.key expression refers to the key of the current element in the for_each loop, which is a string containing the name of the secret.

bashCopy code
provisioner "local-exec"{ command= "echo '${data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.secrets[data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.secrets[each.key].name].secret_string}' > ${each.value}"} 
This provisioner block defines a local-exec provisioner, which runs a shell command on the machine running Terraform.
The command argument is a string that contains the command to be executed. In this case, the command is a echo command that writes the secret string of the latest version of the secret to a file named after the current secret.
The data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version and data.aws_secretsmanager_secret data sources are used again to obtain the latest version of the secret and its name, respectively, using the each.key expression to refer to the current secret's name. The resulting secret_string attribute of the data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data source is used as the input to the echo command.
The each.value expression refers to the value of the current element in the for_each loop, which is a string containing the name of the file to write the secret to.
Overall, this Terraform code block creates a null_resource instance for each secret listed in the local.secrets map. For each instance, it uses the data.aws_secretsmanager_secret and data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data sources to get the latest version of the secret and write it to a file with the specified name using a local-exec provisioner. Finally, it sets a trigger that causes the resource to be updated whenever the secret is changed.

provisioner "local-exec" { command = "echo '${data.aws_secretsmanager_secret_version.secrets[data.aws_secretsmanager_secret.secrets[each.key].name].secret_string}' > ${each.value}" } decode this code in simpler words
This provisioner uses the local-exec type, which executes a command locally on the machine running Terraform. In this case, the command is an echo statement that outputs the value of the secret_string attribute from the aws_secretsmanager_secret_version data source for the secret whose name matches the each.key value in the local.secrets map, and redirects it to a file whose name is given by the each.value variable. So, for each entry in the local.secrets map, this provisioner will write the corresponding secret value to a file with the given name.

> ${each.value}" what does this mean
${each.value} is an interpolation syntax that references the value of the current element of the local.secrets map, which is a filename. This is used as the name of the file to be created by the echo command in the provisioner. For example, if each.value is "private_key.txt", the command will create a file called private_key.txt.
